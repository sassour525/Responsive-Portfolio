				I am Shawn Assour and I am currently a student in The University of Texas Coding Bootcamp. This bootcamp is a class offered by their School for Professional Education. I am working to grow my knowledge in web development through this course. I am currently working at a security software company, SailPoint Technologies, located in Austin.

				I have two cats, enjoy exercising, and playing video games. I grew up in the Houston area and graduated from collegage in San Antonio. I went to the University of Texas at San Antonio and recieved a bachelors degree in Business Information Systems. My favorite sport is Hockey. I love to travel and hope to reach every continent before kicking the bucket.

				I look forward to the challenges ahead in this course. Always work to grow your skills and never settle, you will thank yourself later.
